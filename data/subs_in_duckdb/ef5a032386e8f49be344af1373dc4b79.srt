1
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,560
No, I'm excited.

2
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,920
Yo, is my phone in here?

3
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,880
No, it's not.

4
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,990
Can you...

5
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,920
Can you knock next time, please?

6
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,830
Excuse me, nips?

7
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,430
I said, "Can you
knock next time?"

8
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,590
Freaking bum.

9
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,190
Why are you on the floor?

10
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,870
Because I'm looking
for my first aid kit.

11
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,110
Why do you need that?

12
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,630
In case there's a
medical emergency,

13
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,680
isn't that obvious to you?

14
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,310
The only medical emergency
is gonna be me killing you.

15
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,400
Is that right?

16
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,710
You heard me, bitch.

17
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,050
You think they're gonna
have toilet paper there?

18
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
Maybe. I don't know.

19
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,910
Yo, check this out.

20
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,590
Sick.

21
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,270
That's like a
really advanced trick.

22
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,240
Just in case, do you think
I should bring a six pack or?

23
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,190
I don't know.

24
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm not a shitologist.

25
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,270
I don't know the ratio of
squares of toilet paper to ass,

26
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,270
I don't know.

27
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,270
There's four people,
so do the math.

28
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,110
No, it's three people.

29
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,790
No, there's four people.

30
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,710
What?

31
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,910
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,430
Allie's bringing
her boyfriend.

33
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,270
What?

34
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,190
That's news to me.

35
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,330
I thought this
was supposed to be

36
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,630
a cousins-only camping trip.

37
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,030
That's what Mom
said, I don't know.

38
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,790
I didn't even know Allie
had a boyfriend.

39
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,840
Well, apparently she does.

40
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,510
Mom, I know how couples are.

41
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,510
I have many friends who are
in relationships at school.

42
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,040
They're just gonna be
having sex the whole time.

43
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,750
They're not gonna
have sex the whole time.

44
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,150
Maybe not like the whole
time, but it'll be a marathon.

45
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,870
Okay.

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,070
You love Allie, right?

47
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,750
Yes.

48
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,450
So don't you think
there's a pretty good chance

49
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,350
that you'll like
her boyfriend too?

50
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,990
I mean, he's
probably a cool guy.

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,750
He's from Austin.

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,670
Mom, just 'cause
someone's from Austin

53
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,990
or a cool city doesn't
make him a cool person.

54
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,070
Like Tom, he was from Portland.

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,430
Portland's cool. He wasn't.

56
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,350
You gave him a chance and
I really appreciated that.

57
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,150
So don't you think that
Allie deserves the same?

58
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,990
- Hi!
- Hi!

59
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,030
Dan, this is
my Aunt Nicole.

60
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,790
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

61
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,270
Nice to meet you, Dan.

62
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,670
I've heard nice
things about you.

63
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,590
Come on in, come on in.

64
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,790
How was the drive?

65
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,630
It was good.

66
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,830
Long.

67
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,590
- I bet.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,110
Ah, there he is.

69
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,470
Hey!

70
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,310
Hi!

71
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,310
Oh my God!

72
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,430
Oh, it's so good to see you.

73
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,830
So good to see you.

74
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,350
Dude, what the heck?

75
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,510
You're like a man now.

76
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,350
I know, right?

77
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,990
I can't handle it.

78
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,430
Is he taller than Will?

79
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,030
Oh shh, yeah.

80
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,510
Sore subject!

81
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,870
Oh my gosh, I'm so rude.

82
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,190
Jamie, this is my boyfriend,
Dan.

83
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,670
It's good to meet you, bud.

84
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,870
Good to meet you.

85
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,170
These guys
are so excited to go,

86
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,310
especially Jamie.

87
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,510
But obviously let me know if
they give you any trouble.

88
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,910
Oh no, don't worry about that.

89
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,230
I'm sure they'll be fine.

90
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,670
But if not, we can always
feed â€˜em to the bears.

91
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,270
Let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

92
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,790
That's funny but
you know, actually,

93
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,830
I recently read an article

94
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,590
about how two newlyweds
were going camping

95
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,030
in a national park
near here and you know,

96
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,070
they were brutally
mauled by a black bear

97
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,990
and it's just really tragic

98
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,030
and that's why
safety comes first.

99
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,110
Like bear boxes, bear spray,

100
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,350
all those important
things, so yeah.

101
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,470
That's terrible.

102
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,870
Yeah.

103
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,020
So, on Sunday you can
drop them off whenever,

104
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,790
but I have tennis till 2.

105
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,990
Okay, sounds good.

106
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,350
Do you want us to wait or?

107
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,150
No, they're fine.

108
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,870
It should take
about three hours.

109
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,030
Alright, love you!

110
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,070
Bye!

111
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,310
You all good back there?

112
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,390
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,350
- No, we're chillin'.
- We're good.

114
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,910
Alright, let's hit it.

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,790
Bye, bye!

116
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,630
Bye!

117
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,940
Bye, honey!

118
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,310
Yo Allie,

119
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,640
is there gonna be
service at the campsite?

120
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,310
Not really,
do you need it?

121
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,350
I'm just trying
to watch the game.

122
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,830
Hey yo, what game
are you talking about?

123
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,030
Warriors, Mavs.

124
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,950
Who you got?

125
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,670
Warriors.

126
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,660
Okay.

127
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,030
What, you're
going for the Mavs?

128
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,420
Bro, I'm from Texas, of
course I'm going with the Mavs.

129
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,580
Nah, you're goofy.

130
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,430
I'm goofy?

131
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,550
Who's gonna check Luka?

132
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,780
Uh, how about
Draymond or Klay?

133
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,550
Pick one.

134
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,140
Nah bro, those guys are bums.

135
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,290
- They're bums?!
- Bro, first of all,

136
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,670
it doesn't even matter
who they put on Luka

137
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,070
'cause he's gonna
get thirty anyway.

138
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,300
No he's not!

139
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,090
I'll bet you my car
that the Mavs beat the Warriors.

140
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,990
I will take that bet.

141
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,870
Bet it.

142
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,960
I will totally take that bet.

143
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,590
- Alright.
- That's a W.

144
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,790
How about you man?
Who you got?

145
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,910
Oh, I don't watch much
basketball anymore, so.

146
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,290
Jamie doesn't care
about sports, Dan.

147
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,460
If it's not Barefoot
Contessa, he's not interested.

148
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,310
Oh yeah?

149
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,870
That's too bad man.

150
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,710
This would be a
dope ass place to trip balls.

151
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,790
Yo, Allie, you know where
I could get some shrooms?

152
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,030
Oh my god.

153
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,390
It doesn't gotta be shrooms,
like, it could be DMT,

154
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,140
I'm game for some hardcore shit.

155
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,240
I think our friend just
started selling them actually.

156
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,180
Why would you tell him that?

157
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,150
Yo!

158
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,260
Oh shit!

159
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,870
Easy bud.

160
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,990
We got glass in there.

161
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,430
Oh, sorry.

162
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,950
Hey yo, Dan the man,
can I get your friend's number?

163
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,260
Do not give
him Scott's number.

164
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,710
Okay, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

165
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,430
Alright, you got
the buns in here.

166
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,940
Got the Pop-Tarts, why'd
you get Cookies â€˜n Cream?

167
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,950
- Jamie likes them.
- Oh.

168
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,830
Tapatio chips.

169
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,500
Wow, yeah, I didn't even
know that was a thing.

170
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,430
- Thanks, babe.
- You're welcome.

171
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,220
What?

172
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,310
I was just saying um...

173
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,740
I got the snacks.
It's all good though.

174
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,230
Okay.

175
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,630
Well, yeah
thanks bud, appreciate it.

176
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,070
Yeah.

177
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,710
You got your side?

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,150
- Yeah.
- Okay.

179
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,710
Boom.

180
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,910
Push it up a little bit.

181
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,740
Yeah.

182
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,870
There we go.

183
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,900
You got yours?
Huh, you need some help?

184
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,060
No.

185
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,030
I got it.

186
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,620
Look at that.

187
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,910
It took like two seconds.

188
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,140
Yeah, these are like
the easiest to set up.

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,270
Hey man,
you need a hand?

190
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,110
No, I got it.

191
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,860
I got it.

192
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,910
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,300
Have you actually ever
set up a tent before or?

194
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,310
No, but it can't be that hard.

195
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,590
- Oh, okay.
- It's not rocket science.

196
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,280
Just be easy with it,
alright, because we...

197
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,380
Yep, I know.

198
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,710
- Here, let me just grab...
- I got it.

199
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,180
Oh!

200
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,110
Oh shit!

201
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,900
Yeah, yeah.

202
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,510
See that's what I was afraid of.

203
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,060
Sorry, um.

204
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,900
It's all good, man.

205
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,560
Why don't you do me a favor and
go in the glove box

206
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,980
and grab some tape for me?

207
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,470
Yeah, glove box.

208
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,460
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,100
Hey Will, what do
you think about Dan?

210
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,590
He's chill.

211
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,030
I feel like he doesn't
like me for some reason.

212
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,180
It's probably because
he doesn't respect you.

213
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,340
Do you think he respects you?

214
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,030
Of course he does.

215
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,660
Stop!

216
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,820
Sorry.

217
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,300
I said-

218
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,830
Mmm, yummy boys in my lake.

219
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,190
Don't mind if I nibble.

220
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,260
Alright, that's enough.

221
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,660
Stop, get away from me.

222
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,300
What?

223
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,580
I'm just a sexy sea monster.

224
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,620
- Nothing to be afraid of.
- Okay.

225
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,580
Stop!

226
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,900
Sexy sea monster is disgusting.

227
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,020
How dare you!

228
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,110
- Give me some nips.
- Oh no, no.

229
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,420
Give me the nips.

230
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,700
Give me the nips!

231
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,190
Not that fast.

232
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,180
Will?

233
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,900
What are you, what
are you looking at?

234
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,580
The blonde one's
pretty hot.

235
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,380
Yeah, sure.

236
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,350
I wonder if they're
staying the night.

237
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,620
I'm not really in the mood

238
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,110
to go hang out
with random people.

239
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,340
Listen dude,

240
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,590
you still haven't had your
first hookup, right?

241
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,380
No, but I want to do
it with someone I value,

242
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,750
someone I care about, you know.

243
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,670
How about this?

244
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,800
Hook up with pigtails over there

245
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,540
so you won't be complete trash

246
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,500
when you get with someone
you actually like.

247
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,460
Will, that does
not sound very nice.

248
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,260
Listen, Jamie, girls love guys

249
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,180
who have hooked up with
a ton of other girls.

250
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,740
It makes them feel like
they're part of a harem.

251
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,760
Do you know what a harem is?

252
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,190
Yeah, Will, I know
what a harem is,

253
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,200
but I don't think it, like,
makes sense in this context.

254
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,950
Well, it does.

255
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,830
You're just not listening.

256
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,420
I'll take the lead, alright?

257
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,060
Let's move.

258
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,180
Yo, what's up?

259
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,460
Do you guys know if there's
any piranhas in this lake?

260
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,430
No, why?

261
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,660
I swear I felt
something bite me earlier.

262
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,020
Maybe I'm just tripping.
I smoked earlier,

263
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,510
so I don't know.

264
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,580
I could be buggin'.

265
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,070
Anyway, what are
you guys doing here?

266
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,180
What's up?

267
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,700
We're just here
with our parents.

268
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,060
- Yeah.
- Nice.

269
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,260
What about you guys?

270
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,140
We're here with our cousin.

271
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,710
It's a vibe.

272
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,780
The terrain is
a little uneven.

273
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,230
Yeah.

274
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,820
Anyway, have you
guys, like, been here before?

275
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,020
No, it's
our first time.

276
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,460
Our campsite is kind of gross.

277
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,340
It's next to the bathroom.

278
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,790
It's pretty smelly.

279
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh no.

280
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,380
Gross.

281
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,820
That's ass, I'm sorry.

282
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,910
Which one are you guys at?

283
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,550
13, I think.

284
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,820
Oh really?

285
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,280
I think we're like 14
or something like that.

286
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,390
- So that's like-
- Will, we're actually 22.

287
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,270
We are?

288
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,340
Yeah.

289
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,500
Whatever.

290
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,820
So we're just gonna kinda
just be chilling later tonight

291
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,940
if you guys wanna pull up.

292
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,670
Yeah, we could maybe do that.

293
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,660
Word.

294
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,910
Nice.

295
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,500
- Oh! Sorry.
- Oh geez!

296
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

297
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,580
Allie...

298
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,680
Are you gonna do that again?

299
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,460
- No, see, stop.
- No, it's a trickle.

300
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
- It's a trickle.
- Okay, okay.

301
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,900
Have you talked
to Dennis recently?

302
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,420
Not since my bar mitzvah.

303
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,420
Why?

304
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,220
Is he okay?

305
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,380
He's, like, different right?

306
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,660
Different.

307
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,780
Dude......different...

308
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,240
- Stop!
- You know what I'm talking about!

309
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,460
Okay.

310
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,630
Okay, you know what
I'm talking about.

311
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
I do know what you're
talking about actually.

312
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,430
Oh.

313
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,940
Isabelle got arrested.

314
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,260
- You're joking.
- Yeah.

315
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,520
Apparently she was selling
fake designer handbags.

316
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,760
She actually tried
to sell me one.

317
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,980
Well, I'm not that
surprised about that

318
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,300
because I'm pretty sure

319
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,380
she's the one who stole my
Switch last Thanksgiving.

320
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,140
Oh my God.

321
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,140
What you guys
playing over here?

322
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,860
- Gin Rummy.
- Oh yeah?

323
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,220
Don't they play that
in, like, nursing homes?

324
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,060
Oh huh?

325
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,660
No, it's actually
an all ages game.

326
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,240
Hey baby, why don't you grab
the kindling for me, alright?

327
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,340
I'm about to get started.

328
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,220
Okay, but we're in
the middle of a game.

329
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,390
Yeah, but you said
you were hungry, right?

330
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,300
You wanted me to make dinner.

331
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,620
Can you, like, wait
just like one minute?

332
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,100
Yeah, okay.

333
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,550
You guys forget about
it, I'll just ask Will.

334
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,260
No, I'll do it, Dan.

335
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,340
- I'll do it.
- Jamie, no, you don't have to.

336
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,980
- I'll do it.
- I'm serious.

337
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,740
I got it, relax, I got it.

338
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,220
Just kindling,
anything else, man?

339
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,980
No, no, no, that's it, yeah.

340
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,830
Thanks, bud.

341
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,660
Cool, be right back.

342
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,580
How's this?

343
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,220
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's
a good haul, man, yeah.

344
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,180
That's more than enough.

345
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,700
- Thank you.
- Great.

346
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,180
Okay.

347
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,540
I threw in some pine
cones for extra fuel.

348
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,980
Alright, cool.

349
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,860
Hey, you wanna help
me build a fire?

350
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,460
No, no. It's okay.

351
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,020
Have you ever done it before?

352
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,180
Well, kind of,
but not like fully.

353
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,300
Oh man, it's easy,
here, pop a squat.

354
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,060
Okay.

355
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
So first thing you gotta do,

356
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,040
you gotta take these dried twigs
and throw it in here

357
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,940
kind of like as the base.

358
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,620
- How many, like...
- Yeah.

359
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,740
-That many?

360
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,900
Yeah a few more, a
few more, a few more.

361
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,180
Yeah, maybe a couple more.

362
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,540
Grab this nice one here.

363
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,890
- Okay.
- Cool.

364
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,660
And then what you do is,
you take these guys

365
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,970
and you do kind of like
a log cabin thing.

366
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,340
Go ahead and try.

367
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,780
Yeah.

368
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,540
Cool, now you strike your match.

369
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,660
- Oh shit, sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

370
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,240
No, no, no it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool.

371
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,130
Just try it again.

372
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,260
See? You got it.

373
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,460
Now just throw it on in.

374
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,580
Just like?

375
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,360
Yeah, just throw it in, man.

376
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,220
It's not gonna
bite you, go ahead.

377
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,180
Boom.

378
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Yeah, now we just
let it do its thing.

379
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,980
- Okay.
- Good job man.

380
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,300
Boom.

381
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,100
Are we having burgers?

382
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,250
Yeah bud, it should be
about say, 20 minutes or so.

383
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,180
Yeah, nice.

384
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,820
How do you spice them?

385
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm sorry?

386
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,170
Like, what's your spice blend?

387
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,460
What spice blend?

388
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,860
Don't
listen to her, man.

389
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,390
You know, I just use a little
salt, a little pepper, man.

390
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,900
I like to keep it
simple. It's good.

391
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,860
Yeah, um...

392
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,700
You ever tried using paprika?

393
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,700
No, I haven't.

394
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,540
Sounds good.

395
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,980
Maybe next time.

396
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,370
Well, actually on that note,

397
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,020
I did bring a couple options...

398
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,660
if we wanna spice things up.

399
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,740
Ooh, nice.

400
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,260
Boom.

401
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,660
But we don't have to use them
if we don't want to here.

402
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,500
No, no, no.

403
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,300
This is cool.

404
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,660
Great.

405
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,020
Hey, good choice.

406
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,050
I'm actually pretty obsessed
with that right now.

407
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,980
It gives everything this
beautiful kick, you know?

408
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,500
How old are you again?

409
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,570
14.

410
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,500
Wow!

411
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,420
- 14?
- Yeah.

412
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,220
When I was 14, I was
dumbass.

413
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,300
This kid's a gourmet
chef? Got me beat, man.

414
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,540
These are bomb, thanks Dan.

415
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,380
No, bro.

416
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,660
Don't thank me.

417
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,780
Thank Chef Jamie over here.

418
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,220
He's the one who took
them to the next level.

419
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,490
Oh, you're too kind.

420
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,620
If I'm gonna be honest,

421
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,940
I would go a little
lighter on that cayenne.

422
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,010
But overall, I'm actually
pretty happy with them.

423
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,820
I think they're perfect.

424
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,980
- Yeah, bro.
- Thank you.

425
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,540
Alright, don't get
a big head or anything.

426
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,730
They're good but they're not
the best burgers I've ever had.

427
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,770
Okay, whatever.

428
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,940
- You a food critic, bro?
- Me?

429
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,740
I didn't realize you
were a food critic.

430
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,730
I'm not.

431
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,650
I'm just saying I've
had better burgers.

432
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,460
Oh you work for
The New York Times?

433
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,710
You're publishing a
list of the best burgers

434
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,900
you've ever had?

435
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,460
Because if so, bro, just let
me know when the list comes out

436
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,500
because I'd love to
see where we rank.

437
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,970
Dog, what?

438
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,700
Whatever, I was just
fucking with him.

439
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,610
It's not a big deal.

440
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,100
Yo Dan, can I cop some?

441
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,250
Will, give it up.

442
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,820
We're not giving you shrooms.

443
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,910
We're not giving you alcohol.

444
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,920
We are not those people for you.

445
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,170
Why not?

446
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,490
My friends and I drink a
handle every fucking weekend.

447
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,860
We get turnt the fuck up.

448
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh wow, ya'll must
be the coolest kids in school.

449
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,990
Babe, come on, one sip?

450
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,420
That's not gonna do
anything, right?

451
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,510
- Thank you, Dan.
- It doesn't matter.

452
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,300
His mom would kill me.

453
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,630
You heard her
man, she's the boss.

454
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,410
- Come on!
- What are we doing for teams?

455
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,580
Jamie, you wanna be with me?

456
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,220
-Umm.

457
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,900
Yeah, we could do that.

458
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,810
But we could also like,

459
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,580
I don't know, do me and
Dan versus you guys?

460
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,970
Oh yeah, yeah.

461
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,290
Only because we're
just so good together,

462
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,850
it would be unfair, so...

463
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,450
Okay.

464
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,010
Dan, is that cool with you?

465
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,140
You and Jamie?

466
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,420
Yeah, that's
cool. The big boys.

467
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,980
Yeah.

468
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,650
It's like a place to put
your ass when you're tired.

469
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,740
Oh, bed.

470
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,660
No, it's like a
couch, but it's outside.

471
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,330
Oh, uh, ugh!

472
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,460
Trash.

473
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,700
- No, eyes on me, no, no!
- Futon, day bed, wheelchair.

474
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,330
Close.

475
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,650
Take out the wheels.

476
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,610
- Chair.
- No!

477
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,260
Time!

478
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,660
It was a bench, Allie.

479
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,580
What?

480
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,890
I can't see, so
I'm gonna grab a-

481
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,940
- Night goggles?
- But it's one thing.

482
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,340
A light, a flashlight!

483
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,340
Whoo!

484
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,100
It's a big opening that
you travel through.

485
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,130
A portal.

486
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,340
Yeah, but you would drive
a vehicle through it.

487
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,410
- Like a tunnel.
- Tunnel!

488
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,500
Oh my God!

489
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,650
Okay. Uh. Um.

490
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,050
Uh, what?

491
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,490
It's on your head.

492
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,740
- Horns, hair.
- Uh, oh.

493
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,970
Wait uh , I
don't know what to say...

494
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,900
Just say the thing, please!

495
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,370
At the end of a cat it's a?

496
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,130
- Tail.
- Yeah, okay.

497
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,250
What do dreidels do?

498
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,220
- Spin?
- Yeah.

499
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,180
A tailspin?

500
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,940
Yes, yes, yes.

501
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,020
When you come out of the bath,

502
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,290
the state of your body?

503
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,250
Clean?

504
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,540
Not only is it
clean, hopefully.

505
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,530
- You're wet.
- Yeah.

506
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,300
Damn, you're good.

507
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,100
Creaky bones.

508
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,890
- Arthritis?
- Yeah, what?

509
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,810
- What?
- You're cheating!

510
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,770
Bullshit.

511
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,180
They're hating bro.

512
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,570
I think I might eat these
marshmallows right out the bag!

513
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,670
- You gotta give me one!
- Want one, bro?

514
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,490
Yes, I do!

515
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,580
There you go.

516
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,610
Oh!

517
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,050
Hey, all yours bud.

518
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,340
Thanks.

519
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,730
Good night, guys!

520
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,690
Oh shit!

521
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
Sorry about that.

522
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,100
Didn't mean to scare you.

523
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,810
It's fine.

524
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,610
- Good night.
- Good night.

525
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,770
Dan, thanks for letting me
cook with you today.

526
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,380
That was really fun.

527
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,410
Of course,
man, you're a pro.

528
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,580
Thanks.

529
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,410
And you know, if you're ever
down to cook some other stuff,

530
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,850
we should totally do that.

531
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,970
Hell yeah
man, that sounds good.

532
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,450
We'll try something
in the morning.

533
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,770
Yeah, cool.

534
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,940
I saw you guys got some, uh...

535
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,570
...some bacon, some sausage,
eggs

536
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,580
and yogurt, crackers,
all the good stuff.

537
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,530
But if we're gonna make
the eggs, we need milk.

538
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,970
Did you bring milk?

539
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,450
Uh, I don't know,
I don't think so.

540
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,250
All good.

541
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,170
We can improvise.

542
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,010
Sounds good.

543
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,970
Um.

544
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,420
Well...

545
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,940
- Good night.
- Good night.

546
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,970
Good night.

547
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,770
Alright.

548
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,420
It's 11.

549
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,620
Let's head out.

550
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,730
What?

551
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,810
Let's go.

552
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,530
Those girls are waiting for us.

553
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,250
Will, are we really, like,
still doing this?

554
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,810
- Yes.
- I'm so tired.

555
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,130
Then wake up.

556
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,970
Let's go.

557
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,210
I am not ready
for this, I don't...

558
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,650
Dog, look, look at me.

559
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,530
Don't worry, you're fine,
alright?

560
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,330
You're ready.
You're just nervous.

561
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,530
It's gonna be fun.

562
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,490
You know I'm trying to
help you right now, right?

563
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,690
You're 14.

564
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,010
You need to get some ass, Jamie.

565
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,610
It's just, like, this
way doesn't feel right.

566
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,530
Are you gay?

567
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,610
Will, I'm not...

568
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,420
No, seriously, are you gay?

569
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,490
Will, I'm not gay, okay?

570
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,170
No, no, it's fine if you are.

571
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,390
Just tell me so I
know not to sleep

572
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,850
in the same tent as you.

573
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,610
Will,
what are you doing?

574
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,050
Shh, it's fine.

575
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,730
No Will,
put that back.

576
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,930
Shut the fuck up.

577
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,050
They're
gonna be so mad, dude.

578
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,390
Look, they
won't even notice.

579
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,450
Put it back, put
it back, put it back, Will,

580
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,130
put it back.

581
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,210
Fuck!

582
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,530
You did not go
to Cabo with Post Malone.

583
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,490
I did.

584
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,410
My dad's friend knows
him, so he hooked us up.

585
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,540
We smoked a fat
blunt together too.

586
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,570
Okay, you're such a liar.

587
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,930
I swear to God.

588
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,250
I was pretty disappointed
when the English dub came out.

589
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,690
Usually the animation studio
does really good English dubs.

590
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,300
But this one basically
made no sense.

591
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,530
Thank God I read the manga

592
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,290
or I'd have no idea
what was actually going on.

593
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,890
So do you always watch
the anime with the dub or?

594
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,810
Not necessarily.

595
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,130
If I really like a series,

596
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,210
I'll watch it once with the dub
and once with the sub.

597
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,030
Like in "Psycho Hunt"
there's this one character

598
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,350
who's like a really
good detective.

599
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,250
In the sub, he says,
"Let's set a mouse trap."

600
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,810
But in the dubbed
version, he says,

601
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,330
â€œI'd like to give this
mouse some of my cheese."

602
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,970
Question mark?

603
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,250
Thank you.

604
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,410
Thanks, Will.

605
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,850
Oh, uh, thanks, Erika.

606
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,770
I've already had enough.

607
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,410
I really shouldn't.

608
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,370
Okay.

609
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,530
Are you, like, cold?

610
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,530
A little.

611
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,810
Is that better?

612
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,090
Yeah.

613
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,690
Anyway, sorry, keep
talking.

614
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,450
Yeah, so, uh...

615
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,290
Oh, you have an eyelash, wait.

616
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,530
- Ow!
- Oh, oh, sorry, Erika.

617
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,530
Are you okay?

618
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

619
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,970
Okay.

620
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,570
So should I like make a
wish or something?

621
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,530
I don't know.

622
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,050
Do you wanna make a wish?

623
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,250
Sure.

624
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,450
Go for it.

625
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,450
What'd you wish for?

626
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,680
I can't tell you.

627
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,490
That would make it not
come true.

628
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,930
Yeah.

629
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,010
Okay.

630
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,610
Did it come true?

631
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,920
Sort of.

632
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,650
Well, I'm not like
a mind reader, so...

633
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,890
that was my best guess.

634
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,770
You're close.

635
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,730
Hold on one second, Erika.

636
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,050
The alcohol is making
me a little dizzy.

637
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,890
I'll be back.

638
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,050
I've always
wanted a tattoo.

639
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,890
You would look really
good with a tramp stamp.

640
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,250
What?

641
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,890
Jamie!

642
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,810
Are you drunk?

643
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,850
Uh, I...

644
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,810
I think so.

645
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,340
- Oh my God.
- I'm a little drunk.

646
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,370
I have never
seen him like this.

647
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,690
I mean, I've seen some shit

648
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,850
'cause me and my friends
drink a handle every weekend.

649
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,890
But we have never
been this fucked up.

650
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,170
Will, come here for a second.

651
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,450
How much did you drink?

652
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,810
Way too much, man.

653
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,090
I think I need to go back.

654
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,890
I think I'm gonna puke.

655
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,650
Just puke here.

656
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,890
- No, no.
- Literally right here.

657
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,090
No, you don't understand, Will.

658
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,690
Will, I need to be
next to the car.

659
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,250
- This is the Jamie divot.
- It's not a joking matter, Will!

660
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,410
I need to go back to the car

661
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,120
so Allie can take me to
the hospital if need be.

662
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,610
Dog, what are you doing?

663
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,330
You're doing great.

664
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,160
Don't fuck it up now.

665
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,170
Okay?

666
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,360
Come on, get up.

667
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,210
Uppies, uppies, this way.

668
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,890
Oh, Jesus.

669
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,690
Okay, yeah.

670
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,650
He's all good.

671
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,930
He just needed a second.

672
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,960
Okay.

673
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,050
Yo, Quinn.

674
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,890
I saw some cool-looking
shit, like right over there,

675
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,770
if you wanna check it out.

676
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,850
I mean, you're good, right?

677
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,410
Yeah.

678
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,080
- Sure.
- Alright.

679
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,090
Yo!

680
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,410
Don't let him leave.

681
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,450
He's just nervous
'cause he likes you.

682
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,050
Toodle-loo.

683
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,560
You're so obvious.

684
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,290
Nah, nah, nah.

685
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,610
So...

686
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,290
Did you still wanna
guess what I wished for?

687
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,450
I don't know, I'm so drunk,

688
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,610
I can't even remember
my own name right now.

689
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,170
Okay.

690
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Are you mad
you're not with Quinn?

691
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,490
What?

692
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,250
It's fine if you are.

693
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,810
I know how pretty she is.

694
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,600
No, no, no, I'm
happy I'm with you.

695
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,570
Okay.

696
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,970
It just didn't seem like it,
so I wanted to ask.

697
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,250
I'm so sorry that I'm
coming off the way that I am.

698
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,760
I think you are a very kind
and funny and beautiful woman.

699
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,610
And you know, if I weren't
so drunk right now,

700
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:34,600
I'd totally want to do anything
you wanted, like, to do together.

701
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,640
And it's my fault that I'm
so drunk, not yours, mine.

702
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,730
And so, I'm sorry.

703
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,370
Okay.

704
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,650
Does that make sense?

705
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,160
Yeah.

706
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,040
Thanks for saying that.

707
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,170
Yeah, of course.

708
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,600
Maybe next time you
shouldn't drink so much.

709
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,440
Yeah.

710
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,280
It's kind of becoming a problem.

711
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,250
Hello?

712
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,170
Jamie?

713
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,200
Hey, Dan.

714
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,120
I was just coming
back from the bathroom

715
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,050
and I'm going right
back to my tent.

716
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm just, like, passing by.

717
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,520
What's that in your pocket?

718
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,890
What?

719
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,080
Come here.

720
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,800
Please don't tell Allie.

721
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
Come on bro, I'm
not gonna tell her.

722
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,640
Okay.

723
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,400
And I didn't drink
any by the way.

724
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,200
How come?

725
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,200
Well, I felt bad doing it
without your permission, so.

726
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,080
Bro, come on.

727
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,720
You got my permission,
but only if you want to.

728
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,600
Sure.

729
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,680
Easy, easy.

730
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,960
Baby sips.

731
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,330
Where's Will?

732
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,290
He's not with you?

733
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,560
He's with a girl from
another campsite, I think.

734
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,170
I see.

735
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,280
That guy gives you
a lot of shit, huh?

736
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,440
Yeah, I mean, he's just, like,
fucking around, so it's okay.

737
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,760
Yeah.

738
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,680
Hey, look man, I know I just
met you and everything, but

739
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
I get it.

740
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,480
I got two older brothers
and they were vicious, man.

741
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
I mean, they were really mean.

742
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,640
They used to kick my
ass and call me fat.

743
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,010
Fart on me in my sleep.

744
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,890
Will did that once.

745
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,880
I bet he did.

746
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,170
Anyway, what I'm
trying to say is

747
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,000
sometimes you
gotta dish it back,

748
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,880
otherwise they'll
walk all over you.

749
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,200
Just a little advice from one
little brother to another.

750
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,840
Yeah.

751
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,210
Dan?

752
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,410
Yeah, babe?

753
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,640
Who are you talking to?

754
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,760
No one.

755
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
You must be dreaming.

756
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,280
See you in the morning, bud.

757
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Oh sorry, I didn't
know you were in here.

758
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,520
You wanna come in?

759
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,730
Oh, sorry, I didn't
know you were in here.

760
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
You wanna come in?

761
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,240
Get in here, bud.

762
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,840
Oh, that feels so good.

763
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,160
Yeah, you needed this.

764
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,170
You seem stressed.

765
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
Do I?

766
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,680
It's cool.

767
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,360
I'm stressed too.

768
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,960
What are you stressed about?

769
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,720
Me and Allie, we've been
fighting a lot recently.

770
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm probably gonna break up
with her when we get back home.

771
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,400
Oh.

772
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
I'm so sorry to hear that.

773
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,920
Oh no, it's all good.

774
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,360
I've got you now.

775
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,710
Are you awake?

776
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,440
- Hmm, what?
- Jamie!

777
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,990
Yeah, what's up?

778
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,190
Did you guys hook up?

779
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,800
What?

780
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,680
Did you guys hook up?

781
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,750
Oh yeah, we did.

782
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,320
Yes!

783
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,480
Yo!

784
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,000
Let's go.

785
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,800
Shh, you're gonna
wake up everyone.

786
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

787
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,590
I'm just pumped for you, bruh.

788
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,910
So, shit.

789
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,080
Was it dope?

790
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,800
Yeah, it was cool.

791
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,550
Nice.

792
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,880
Yeah, mine was too.

793
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,280
She's a freak.

794
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,680
Nice.

795
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,480
Yeah.

796
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,550
Whoo.

797
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,120
Fucking love that shit.

798
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,880
I'm a little tired.

799
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,400
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

800
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,750
Alright, man, yeah.

801
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,470
You get your well-needed sleep
after a big night like that.

802
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,840
You deserve it.

803
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,200
Thanks.

804
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,440
Good night.

805
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,920
Good night.

806
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,270
Big man.

807
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
Breakfast is ready.

808
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,320
Pop-Tarts.

809
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,320
Sweet.

810
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,840
Thanks.

811
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,720
How'd you sleep?

812
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,680
I slept okay.

813
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,030
How about you?

814
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,990
Eh.

815
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,200
Not great.

816
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,400
Oh.

817
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,270
What does your shirt say?

818
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,270
Oh yeah.

819
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,920
uh leash, uh keys.

820
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,720
Cute, I love her.

821
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,270
Oh yeah, we do too.

822
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,710
Like, you love her
or, like, Dan loves her?

823
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,350
Dan loves Alicia Keys.

824
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,320
Are you serious about that?

825
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,160
Yeah no, we met at
one of her concerts.

826
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,310
Hey, I was looking
in the cooler earlier

827
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,440
and we're missing a
hot dog from that new pack.

828
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,240
Did one of you boys eat
a raw hot dog last night?

829
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,430
Not that I remember.

830
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,160
Did I?

831
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,600
Yeah, it was probably you.

832
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,680
I mean, you were so
drunk last night,

833
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,430
I wouldn't be surprised.

834
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,430
Oh God.

835
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,920
Morning.

836
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,920
Hey, morning.

837
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,110
There he is.

838
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,080
Morning, Dan.

839
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,200
Hey, morning, morning.

840
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,830
How you holding up?

841
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,600
Hey, Dan.

842
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,830
Hey, what's up bud?

843
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,550
Sorry to bug you, but I
drew this picture of you

844
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,150
and thought you
might wanna see it.

845
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,160
Oh yeah?

846
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,310
Oh wow.

847
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,600
That's me.

848
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,510
Oh yeah, that's
something there, man.

849
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,430
You're really talented.

850
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,080
Oh look, you got the Alicia
Keys quote on there.

851
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,830
Yeah.

852
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,310
Allie told me you are a big fan,

853
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,430
so I had to throw it in
there, like, of course.

854
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,470
She's the greatest.

855
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:04,910
Oh yeah, she's the best.

856
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,870
My mom used to play
her for me all the time

857
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,240
when I was younger.
I practically grew up on her.

858
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,270
You ever been to
one of her concerts?

859
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,630
No, but I'd love to.

860
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,400
Oh yeah, man,
it's a great time.

861
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,380
I've heard great things, so.

862
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

863
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,390
And she's still hot. To be 42?

864
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,430
Yeah, yes she is.

865
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,750
Yeah, so I dunno,
thought I'd show you.

866
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,510
Oh yeah, thanks bud.

867
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,790
Yeah.

868
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,640
Catch you later.

869
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,670
Yeah.

870
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,840
Hey, Jamie, come here!

871
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,630
What?

872
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,270
Just come
here real quick.

873
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,790
You're just scared
I'm gonna be right.

874
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,590
Okay, word.

875
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,790
See what happens.

876
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,750
- Come here.
- We shall.

877
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,550
- We shall, we shall what?
- Come on.

878
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,030
Bustle over here, bud.

879
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,150
Come here.

880
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,750
- Dude.
- Take a seat.

881
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,870
Dan thinks you're better
than me at arm wrestling.

882
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:29,870
So come here.

883
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:30,890
You gotta show
him who's boss, bud.

884
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,110
No.

885
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,950
Guys.

886
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,790
Come on, I wanna see you lose.

887
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:34,750
Come here.

888
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,350
Dude, it's fine.

889
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,310
We can arm wrestle
some other time.

890
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,350
Dog, just sit on the bench.

891
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,590
Come.

892
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,710
- Thank you.
- Okay.

893
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,670
Okay.

894
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,670
Stubborn as fuck.

895
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,070
Here we go, you ready?

896
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,430
You're good.

897
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,550
Come on, you got it.

898
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,430
Eye of the tiger.

899
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,910
Call it off.

900
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,590
One, two, three, go.

901
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,590
Ooh.

902
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:01,990
Ah.

903
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,200
Here we go.

904
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,750
Yeah, here we go.

905
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,030
- Yeah.
- Show me something.

906
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:07,910
Show me something.

907
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,590
Just get him, dude.

908
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,790
Ooh, wow.

909
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:13,550
Yep.

910
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:14,350
What'd I say?

911
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,710
I was right.

912
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,430
Yeah. Well, actually, that
was just my personal warm-up,

913
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,030
so, let's go again.

914
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,560
He wants to go again.

915
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,570
I wanna go again,
I wasn't ready.

916
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,150
I wasn't prepared at all.

917
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,390
He wants to lose twice.

918
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,090
I mean, you didn't wanna
go again, but he does.

919
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,170
- Yeah.
- He just wants to lose again.

920
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,550
- That's chill.
- Come on.

921
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,390
Here we go.

922
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,310
Oh God, I'm nervous now.

923
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:33,510
- You ready?
- Yep.

924
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,130
- Let me get a better position.
- Let's go, let's go, come on.

925
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,990
- Ready?
- Yep.

926
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,070
- Count it off.
- One, two, three, go.

927
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,510
Oh, he's strong.

928
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,830
Just get him, dude.

929
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,630
No, no, no, he's
lasting longer than you.

930
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,070
No, you're going easy on him.

931
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,990
You're fucking
going easy on him.

932
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,080
Just fucking pin him.

933
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,270
I'm going down.

934
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,370
You're
going easy on him.

935
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:52,310
Just fucking pin
him to the ground.

936
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,470
Dog!

937
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,950
Oh!

938
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,290
- What?
- You're a beast, baby!

939
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,730
No, that didn't
fucking count.

940
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,680
It was rigged.

941
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,750
Great job.

942
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:00,970
- That was great.
- That was great.

943
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,390
That was not,
that didn't count.

944
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,840
Dan just let you win, alright?

945
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,750
I actually think it did count.

946
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,990
It was a fair and square fight.

947
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,950
- It was fair.
- No, I don't think it was.

948
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,270
Dan did shot put in college

949
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,720
and you have never
lifted a weight in your life.

950
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,870
Okay, what does that
have to do with this?

951
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,670
Strength?

952
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,030
What the fuck do you mean?

953
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,650
Ok, maybe it doesn't mean
I'm stronger than Dan,

954
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,630
but maybe it just means
that I'm stronger than you.

955
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,800
Ooh!

956
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,000
No, it doesn't mean-

957
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,430
You know that's
not fucking true.

958
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,390
- You're full of shit.
- What?

959
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,070
Just like you were full
of shit last night, right?

960
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,030
What?

961
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:32,150
What do you... what?

962
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,230
What?

963
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,030
I ran into Erika this morning.

964
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,190
Guess what she said.

965
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,990
She said you guys
never hooked up.

966
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,070
Will, stop, you're
talking out of your ass.

967
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,150
Look, Dan,

968
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,070
he had the perfect opportunity

969
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,870
to get with a girl last night.
- Stop.

970
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,630
To finally
hook up with someone

971
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,750
and he just bitched out.

972
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,070
I did not bitch out.

973
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,200
And now he'll probably
never get with a girl.

974
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,110
Will, let me finish,
I didn't bitch out.

975
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,270
- We hooked up like-
- Uh-huh, yeah, sure.

976
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,030
Why're you lying to me?

977
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,670
Now you're lying to Dan?

978
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,350
I'm not lying to you at all.

979
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,430
Yeah, yeah, you are.

980
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,800
Why are you wearing
your hat like that?

981
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,590
Like what? I wear my hat
backwards sometimes. So what?

982
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,310
Are you sure it's not because
you wanna copy Dan?

983
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,950
Shut up.

984
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,870
Hey, easy, easy.

985
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,030
Seriously?

986
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,130
- What? Okay, okay.
- You fucking kidding me?

987
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

988
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,270
- Stop, stop.
- Hey, hey, hey!

989
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:12,750
Ow, Will!

990
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,790
You're fine!

991
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,040
Both of you just
chill out, alright?

992
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:15,910
Hey, I'm good.

993
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:16,470
He's the one that
fucking attacked me.

994
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:17,510
Chill out.

995
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:18,800
I was doing
exactly what you said

996
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:19,960
and I was sticking
up for myself.

997
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,320
Yeah, well, bro,
I didn't mean to hit him.

998
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,390
Well, I didn't know that.

999
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,910
And now I probably
have a concussion, so.

1000
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,190
Let me see, man.

1001
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,830
You're fine, alright?

1002
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,270
How do you know that, Dan?

1003
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,350
I could have brain damage.

1004
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,110
I might as well go to
a hospital right now.

1005
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,550
Come on man,
don't be a baby.

1006
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,670
I'm not a baby!

1007
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,870
Hey, are you okay?

1008
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,110
Does it look
like I'm okay?

1009
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,070
Oh God.

1010
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,950
Dan told me what happened.

1011
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,550
You know it's all
his fault, right?

1012
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,190
I don't really think
that's fair, Jamie.

1013
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,550
You don't think it's fair?

1014
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,590
Well aren't you the one
who brought him on this trip?

1015
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,910
The trip that was supposed to
be us time and is now ruined?

1016
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,830
Okay, can you put the
rocks down for a second

1017
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,150
and talk to me?

1018
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,620
What were you guys
fighting about?

1019
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,350
It's stupid.

1020
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,670
I don't care if it's stupid.

1021
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,070
Will said I couldn't
get with a girl.

1022
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,430
Do you even want that?

1023
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,870
Yes.

1024
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,710
Okay, so then
don't listen to him.

1025
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,590
You're only 14.

1026
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,710
I wasn't hooking up
with people at 14.

1027
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,590
I waited until college.

1028
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,590
Okay?

1029
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,590
You're an amazing person.

1030
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,470
You are a catch.

1031
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:11,230
The right girl is gonna
see that at the right time.

1032
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,670
Yeah, thanks.

1033
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,390
Okay.

1034
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,670
I'm just gonna
give you a minute.

1035
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,230
Babe, do you
want some water?

1036
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,830
No, I'm good.

1037
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,460
Oh, I forgot you're a man.

1038
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,990
You don't drink water.

1039
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,590
Guys, can we
take a break?

1040
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,790
What?

1041
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,830
I said, can we take a break?

1042
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,030
Another?

1043
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,980
Yeah. Just like two minutes.

1044
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,750
It's like so hot.

1045
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,030
Okay.

1046
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,070
So how we feeling?

1047
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,750
This trail goes back to camp.

1048
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,750
Do we wanna just call it?

1049
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:20,790
Yeah, I'm down.

1050
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,670
Wait, hold up.
That's it?

1051
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,140
I thought you guys
wanted to explore more.

1052
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,980
Well, it's
getting late.

1053
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,270
I want get back and
make dinner before dark.

1054
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,990
Hey, bud, you wanna call it
a day or you wanna go with me?

1055
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,150
I'd be down to keep going.

1056
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,470
Really?

1057
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:43,510
Yeah, actually, um, I just
needed that little break.

1058
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,590
And I am ready to go.

1059
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,720
Hey, that's the spirit!

1060
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,880
Babe, look we came
all the way out here,

1061
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,570
we might as well check
this place out, right?

1062
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,580
Yeah.

1063
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,550
I'd really rather not.

1064
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,740
Well, you know, Allie,
you don't have to come.

1065
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,750
Excuse me?

1066
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:59,390
Babe. Look, look,
this trail here,

1067
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,160
it leads right back to the
parking lot anyway, right?

1068
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,540
Yeah. But I've
been that way before.

1069
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,200
You're not gonna get back
for at least three hours.

1070
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,110
Okay. We'll get
back a little late.

1071
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,900
You guys can eat
dinner without us.

1072
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,950
Yeah, don't worry about me.

1073
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,630
I had a late lunch.

1074
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,780
Okay. I am
responsible for him.

1075
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,350
You can't just take
him wherever you want.

1076
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,560
I'm not taking
him wherever I want.

1077
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,650
I'm taking him up another path

1078
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,700
that leads back to
the exact same place.

1079
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,660
Why are you trippin'?

1080
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,430
Yeah, Allie.
Don't trip.

1081
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,510
- Alright, fine, whatever.
- Ok, cool.

1082
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,310
Wait, Allie, Allie.

1083
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,300
What?

1084
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,150
Would you do me a favor

1085
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,790
and bring these back
to my tent for me?

1086
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,150
Thanks.

1087
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,110
Wait up.

1088
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,420
Damn, look at
all those rocks.

1089
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,910
Yeah.

1090
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,140
Looks like they've been
shaping for a long time.

1091
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,300
Huge, big boulders.

1092
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:22,180
Wow, dude, you seeing this?

1093
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,460
Oh wow.

1094
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,190
Oh my goodness.

1095
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,750
- Wow.
- Oh my.

1096
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,900
This is amazing.

1097
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,540
I'm so happy you wanted
to keep exploring.

1098
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,510
This is, like, beautiful.

1099
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,750
I know, man.

1100
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,870
This is dope.

1101
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,940
Yeah.

1102
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,540
- You know what?
- What?

1103
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,470
It kind of looks like "Lord
of the Rings" a little bit, right?

1104
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,580
Yeah, it does.

1105
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,350
It looks exact...
oh my, it does.

1106
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,300
You're so right about that.

1107
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,260
I love those movies.

1108
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:49,780
- Yeah, yeah?
- Yeah.

1109
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:50,900
Me too, I love them.

1110
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,550
Oh, nice.

1111
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,910
And if I had to, man,

1112
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,710
I'd go gay for Viggo
Mortensen, for sure.

1113
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,990
For sure.

1114
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,940
Alright, bud.

1115
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,470
Let's head back.

1116
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,620
One second.

1117
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,820
Do you mind if we take a
picture before we leave

1118
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,040
so we can just get
the background in?

1119
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,310
Oh, yeah, yeah that's cool.

1120
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,310
Cool.

1121
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,020
Alrighty.

1122
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,460
Okay.

1123
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,260
Alrighty.

1124
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,990
- Alright.
- Let's head out.

1125
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,060
Okay.

1126
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,990
Am I a fan of "Master
Chef Jr." as a show?

1127
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,910
Yeah, sure.

1128
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,950
Actually I think it's
pretty entertaining.

1129
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:43,420
But it boils down to this
stupid beauty pageant.

1130
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,220
'cause none of those kids
can even cook, you know?

1131
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,470
Well, why don't you
make your own show, bud,

1132
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,630
like on YouTube or something?

1133
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,750
You'd make a great host.

1134
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,950
Thank you.

1135
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,020
It's funny you say that

1136
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:53,940
because I've actually
always wanted

1137
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,340
to host a cooking competition.

1138
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,820
I've been putting a lot of
thought into it recently.

1139
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,460
Have a big open set...

1140
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,900
Wait, hold on one sec, bud.

1141
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,500
What?

1142
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,550
Is this the way we came in?

1143
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,750
Yeah, I think so.

1144
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,660
We just have to
keep going downhill.

1145
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,670
Yeah, but this
doesn't look familiar.

1146
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,460
Might have taken the wrong
turn when we left the lookout.

1147
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,460
Damn it.

1148
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,500
Let's go back, man.

1149
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,500
Yeah. Okay, let's go back.

1150
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,470
Yeah.

1151
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,020
This shit is like
brand new.

1152
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,900
I have no idea
where we are, man.

1153
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:51,460
I think if we keep
going down to the path,

1154
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,270
we'll get back to the lookout.

1155
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,580
Yeah, the lookout.

1156
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,510
Where's the lookout?
Do you see the lookout?

1157
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,880
Well, no, I don't
see it right now,

1158
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,580
but if we keep going down
the trail, we can get there.

1159
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,180
I can't even tell if we're
retracing our steps or not.

1160
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,340
Oh shit.

1161
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,580
Oh fuck, of course, I don't
have any service.

1162
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,270
Do you have any
service?

1163
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,340
No.

1164
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,300
But I remember something, Dan.

1165
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,220
At the lookout, there
was a big fallen tree.

1166
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:26,750
And if we can find that tree,
we can find the lookout again.

1167
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,110
Dan, did you see a-

1168
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,670
Hey, can you just stop
talking for like 10 seconds

1169
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,070
so I can try and
figure this out?

1170
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:33,820
Alright?

1171
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,260
Yeah. Sorry.

1172
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,260
Yeah, yeah.

1173
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,860
Fuck.

1174
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:45,230
I don't know how we're
gonna get outta here, man.

1175
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,740
I don't know where we are.

1176
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,940
It's gonna be dark soon
and it's gonna get cold.

1177
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,180
- Fucking bugs.
- Dan?

1178
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,820
Allie is gonna be on my ass,
bro.

1179
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,510
Dan, I think
you're dehydrated.

1180
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:56,620
What?

1181
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,510
Like, you need to drink
some water or have a snack.

1182
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,720
No, no, I'm not
hungry right now.

1183
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,900
I'm trying to get out of here.

1184
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,700
Okay, well, what
did you eat today?

1185
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,820
I don't, I don't know.

1186
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,780
I think I had a Pop-Tart
or something like that.

1187
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1188
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,740
That is not enough, Dan.

1189
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,940
Here.

1190
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,740
What are you doing?

1191
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,620
Take this.

1192
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,340
No.

1193
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,220
I'm serious, Dan, take this.

1194
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,280
I don't, no, I don't want it.

1195
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,100
I want you to eat this.

1196
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,340
- No, no.
- Dan, take it.

1197
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,160
Dude, if you don't get
that shit away from me, bro.

1198
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,020
Look, I don't want
a fucking grano-

1199
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,500
Hey man, thanks.

1200
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:32,270
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

1201
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,260
Good call.

1202
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,340
You want some?

1203
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,590
No, there isn't
much left in there.

1204
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,660
You got it.

1205
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,620
You sure?

1206
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,220
Yeah. Finish it.

1207
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:53,220
Hey, did you see a stream?

1208
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,300
No, why?

1209
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,300
Well, streams run downhill

1210
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,700
and if we can get downhill,

1211
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,460
we can probably find our
way back to the campsite.

1212
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,820
So is this like your
first relationship or?

1213
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,860
Oh no, man.

1214
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:24,460
This is, like, my fourth
long-term relationship

1215
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,140
or something like that.
- Thanks.

1216
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,900
So, like, you guys plan
on getting married, right?

1217
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,180
I don't know, bud.

1218
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,420
I think we're a long
way from that convo.

1219
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,860
Mmhmm.

1220
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,230
You got a girlfriend?

1221
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,660
Oh, not, not at this
exact moment, but...

1222
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,300
Oh yeah?

1223
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,300
Is there a girl you like or?

1224
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of.

1225
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,820
Does she know you like her?

1226
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,910
Oh, probably not.

1227
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,780
No, no, I don't think so.

1228
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,940
You gotta tell her, man.

1229
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,180
Uh...

1230
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,820
For real, you gotta tell her.

1231
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,740
Look, I had a crush on this
girl back in high school

1232
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,460
and we were friends
too, but she was so cool

1233
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,660
I didn't think I had a shot,

1234
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,700
so I kept my mouth
shut for four years.

1235
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,660
Fast forward...

1236
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,780
We graduated from college
and we ran into each other.

1237
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,100
You know what she said?

1238
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:25,300
That she liked me
that whole time.

1239
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:29,060
And even though that was all
those years ago

1240
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:32,020
to be honest, man, it still
fucks with me to this day.

1241
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,820
So...

1242
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,620
Yeah, man.

1243
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:39,620
Learn from my mistake
and just tell her.

1244
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,150
You have no idea what you
could be missing out on.

1245
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,100
Yeah.

1246
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,940
Oh, shit.

1247
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,700
Yo Jamie, I think
that's a stream, man.

1248
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,100
Really?

1249
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,660
Yeah, yeah, come on.

1250
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,940
Oh, thank God, man.

1251
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,220
- Ow!
- Oh shit.

1252
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,770
Oh ow!

1253
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,580
- Wait, hold on.
- Oh fuck.

1254
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,060
- Dude.
- Uh, here, lemme help you up.

1255
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,140
Oh!

1256
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,660
Come on, come on, come on.

1257
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:52,860
I got you, I got you.

1258
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:53,740
Go slow.

1259
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,010
I got you, I got you.

1260
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,060
Easy.

1261
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:57,500
Okay.

1262
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,340
I'm such a fucking idiot.

1263
01:06:59,380 --> 01:06:59,980
No, no, no, no, no.

1264
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:00,820
It's okay, bud, it's good.

1265
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,100
Don't do that, don't do that.

1266
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,100
Damn.

1267
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,020
Here.

1268
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,540
Okay, here we go.

1269
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,620
There you go.

1270
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,380
Easy, easy.

1271
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,740
Okay.

1272
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,700
I'm sorry, is that too tight?

1273
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,100
Oh no, it's good.

1274
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,060
Okay.

1275
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,050
Cool.

1276
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:33,260
Alright.

1277
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,450
You okay?

1278
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,580
Mmhm.

1279
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,300
Okay.

1280
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:43,980
I'm sorry.

1281
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,050
I didn't mean mean for that.

1282
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,180
I don't know why that happened.

1283
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,620
It's cool.

1284
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,020
Can you walk?

1285
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:53,580
Hmm, yep, I can.

1286
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,330
Okay, um, then let's go.

1287
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,380
Fuck.

1288
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,980
Oh shit.

1289
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,010
I can't
believe you got lost.

1290
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,330
You're such a fucking idiot.

1291
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,010
Hello?

1292
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,890
Hello. What?

1293
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,020
Are you, like, okay?

1294
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:37,540
Yeah, I'm fine.

1295
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,700
Are you okay, Will?

1296
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,970
Yeah, I'm chilling.

1297
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,980
Why?

1298
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,820
Oh.

1299
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,690
Here, don't you need this?

1300
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,210
Thanks.

1301
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,260
Hey, Allie.

1302
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,490
Yeah?

1303
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,380
Just wanted to, like,
apologize for the way I acted earlier.

1304
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:29,250
It was super rude and
unacceptable, so I'm sorry.

1305
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,300
It's fine.

1306
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,300
Are you mad at me?

1307
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,290
No, I'm not mad.

1308
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:38,970
Can I come in?

1309
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,730
Yeah.

1310
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,690
What's up?

1311
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,370
I only acted the way I did

1312
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,970
because I wanted
to, like, impress Dan.

1313
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:59,490
And I never meant to hurt
your feelings in any way

1314
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:02,850
because between you and me,
you're my favorite cousin,

1315
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,530
and hurting your feelings is
the last thing I would want.

1316
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:08,340
So, I'm sorry.

1317
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,250
It's okay.

1318
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,300
Why do you feel like you
need to impress Dan so much?

1319
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,500
I don't know.
Just kinda want him to like me.

1320
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,540
He likes you.

1321
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,900
Yeah.

1322
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,900
Thanks.

1323
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:30,810
I made you something that
I thought you might like.

1324
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,850
Really?

1325
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,700
What?

1326
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,770
It's beautiful.

1327
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:46,020
You're such an asshole.

1328
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,780
Are you good?

1329
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:54,770
Yeah.

1330
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:56,850
I'm okay.

1331
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,170
Hey.

1332
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:53,930
Yo.

1333
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:07,490
I'm going back to the
lake one more time

1334
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:09,100
if you want to come.

1335
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,130
You guys sure you don't
want us to stick around?

1336
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,370
Nah, yeah we're fine.

1337
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,130
Mom won't be back for
another two hours.

1338
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,940
You need help
bringing anything inside?

1339
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,290
Nah, we got it.

1340
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,330
Thank you though.

1341
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:14,690
Well, hey, it was
good to meet you boys.

1342
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,890
It was good to
meet you too, man.

1343
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,490
Good to meet you.

1344
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,670
Maybe next time
we're in California,

1345
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,850
we can go to a basketball
game or something.

1346
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:23,490
Yeah, I'm game.

1347
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,730
As long as it's not the Mavs.

1348
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,250
Always a pleasure.

1349
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:31,610
Yeah. Thank you guys.

1350
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:35,330
This was more fun than I
thought it'd be.

1351
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,130
Good.

1352
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,210
Also, let me know if your boy
is down to send the shrooms,

1353
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,650
because honestly, I'm
trying to meet my ancestors,

1354
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:45,690
so just send him my way,
alright?

1355
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:47,730
- You got it.
- Peace!

1356
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,490
- Hey.
- Hey.

1357
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,220
I'll see you at
Thanksgiving, okay?

1358
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,450
Okay. Have a safe trip.

1359
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,570
- Thanks.
- Love you.

1360
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:58,530
Love you.

1361
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:41,450
Hey, Allie, would you mind if
I talk to Dan for a second?

1362
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:44,130
Oh yeah, sure.

1363
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,370
So you need me to...?

1364
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,010
Yeah, that would be great.

1365
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:49,010
Okay.

1366
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:51,170
Thanks.

1367
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,130
Yeah.

1368
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:56,970
Hey, what's up, bud?

1369
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:10,050
I just wanted to talk
to you a little bit

1370
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:14,010
about what went down
in the forest earlier.

1371
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:18,850
Oh. Uh.

1372
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:22,410
Oh man. Look, don't
worry about that.

1373
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:23,640
When I was your age,

1374
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,270
that happened to me all
the time for no reason.

1375
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:28,130
So yeah, don't even sweat it.

1376
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,210
Really.

1377
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,890
Yeah. Um.

1378
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:44,850
It's just I-

1379
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,490
Um, it's just like maybe-

1380
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:56,250
I think it did
happen for a reason.

1381
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:01,610
Oh.

1382
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,530
Oh, okay.

1383
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,650
Uh...

1384
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:17,370
Well hey, that's,
that's cool too.

1385
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:23,560
Really? You're
not, like, mad at me?

1386
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,570
Why would I be mad?

1387
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:29,010
I mean, I think I'm a
little too old for you, man.

1388
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,410
Yeah, yeah, I know.
It's just, um...

1389
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,050
I think you're really handsome.

1390
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,810
Thank you. I'm flattered.

1391
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,450
Really.

1392
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,170
Yeah. Um.

1393
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:48,690
I really appreciate you
talking to me about this.

1394
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:51,970
I think it's pretty
cool that you did.

1395
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:55,010
It's, it's not an
easy thing to do.

1396
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:56,210
No.

1397
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,530
Yeah, um.

1398
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:02,490
Okay, I'll catch you.

1399
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,920
Yeah, I'll see you, bud.

1400
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:08,130
Okay.

1401
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,610
You all good?

1402
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:20,610
Yes.

1403
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:22,530
I'll see you at
Thanksgiving, right?

1404
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,050
- You bet.
- I'll text you.

1405
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,210
Okay.

1406
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,210
Bye.
